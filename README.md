```Recommender systems``` are machine learning systems that help users discover new product and services. Every time you shop online, a recommendation system is guiding you towards the most likely product you might purchase.

Recommender systems are an essential feature in our digital world, as users are often overwhelmed by choice and need help finding what they're looking for. This leads to happier customers and, of course, more sales. Recommender systems are like salesmen who know, based on your history and preferences, what you like.

Some examples of recommender systems in action include product recommendations on Amazon, Netflix suggestions for movies and TV shows in your feed, recommended videos on YouTube, music on Spotify, the Facebook newsfeed and Google Ads.

An important component of any of these systems is the recommender function, which takes information about the user and predicts the rating that user might assign to a product, for example. Predicting user ratings, even before the user has actually provided one, makes recommender systems a powerful tool.

### Difference between collabrative filtering and content based filtering
```Content-based filtering``` does not require other users' data during recommendations to one user. It takes the features of the items into consideration.

```Collaborative filtering``` System does not need the features of the items to be given. Every user and item is described by a feature vector or embedding. It creates embedding for both users and items on its own.
